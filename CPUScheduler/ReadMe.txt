CPU Scheduler (19mcmc47)
Java implementation of 6 CPU scheduling algorithms: 
 1.First Come First Serve (FCFS)
 2.Shortest Job First (SJF)
 3.Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
 4.Priority Non-preemptive (PSN)
 5.Priority Preemptive (PSP)
 6.Round Robin (RR).

For Round Robin--
In the case of RoundRobin, you must first set a time quantum before calling process.
CPUScheduler rr = new RoundRobin();


Example--
An example with different values can be found(src/Main.java).
A Java Swing application using the library is(src/GUI.java) within the project.

Import the project and main files are in (GUI.java) and with example is in (Main.java) to match the values from console.

Thankyou!
